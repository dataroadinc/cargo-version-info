# Markdown Style

- Keep lines to ≤ 70 characters where practical for readability in diffs.

- Place a blank line after each heading.

- Surround lists and code blocks with a blank line above and below.

- In lists, keep indentation consistent; avoid mixing list item
  indentation levels.

- Prefer fenced code blocks with language hints, and avoid trailing
  whitespace.

- Prefer short paragraphs; avoid overly long unbroken text.
