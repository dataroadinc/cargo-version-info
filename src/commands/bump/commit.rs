//! Git commit orchestration for version changes.
//!
//! This module coordinates the process of creating a git commit that contains
//! only version-related changes. This is the heart of the bump command's
//! "selective staging" functionality.
//!
//! # Selective Staging Rationale
//!
//! When bumping a version, we want to commit ONLY the version changes, not
//! any other uncommitted changes that might exist in the working directory.
//!
//! ## Why This Matters
//!
//! Consider this scenario:
//! ```text
//! Working Directory:
//! - Cargo.toml: version changed from 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1
//! - src/main.rs: work-in-progress feature (uncommitted)
//! - README.md: typo fixes (uncommitted)
//! ```
//!
//! We want the bump commit to include ONLY the Cargo.toml version change,
//! not the WIP feature or typo fixes. This keeps the version bump commit
//! clean and focused.
//!
//! # Commit Process
//!
//! The commit process involves several steps:
//!
//! 1. **Discover Repository**: Find the `.git` directory
//! 2. **Verify Changes**: Ensure version actually changed
//! 3. **Detect Other Changes**: Warn if non-version changes exist
//! 4. **Stage File**: Add file to git index
//! 5. **Build Tree**: Convert index to tree object
//! 6. **Create Commit**: Write commit object
//! 7. **Update HEAD**: Move current branch to new commit
//!
//! # Git Porcelain vs. Plumbing
//!
//! Git has two types of commands:
//!
//! ## Porcelain Commands (High-Level)
//! - `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`
//! - User-friendly, handle multiple operations
//! - What most people use day-to-day
//!
//! ## Plumbing Commands (Low-Level)
//! - `git hash-object`, `git update-index`, `git write-tree`
//! - Building blocks for porcelain commands
//! - What this module implements via `gix`
//!
//! By using gix's plumbing-level APIs, we have fine-grained control over
//! exactly what gets staged and committed.
//!
//! # Hunks and Patches
//!
//! In git terminology:
//! - **Hunk**: A contiguous block of changes in a file
//! - **Patch**: A collection of hunks (can span multiple files)
//!
//! Example diff with 2 hunks:
//! ```diff
//! @@ -1,3 +1,3 @@  ← Hunk 1: lines 1-3
//!  [package]
//!  name = "test"
//! -version = "0.1.0"
//! +version = "0.2.0"
//!  
//! @@ -10,2 +10,2 @@  ← Hunk 2: lines 10-11
//! -# Old comment
//! +# New comment
//! ```
//!
//! Our goal is to stage only the version hunk, not the comment hunk.
//!
//! # Current Implementation
//!
//! The current implementation stages the entire file if version changes are
//! detected, with a warning if non-version changes exist. This is simpler than
//! true hunk-level staging but works for the common case.
//!
//! ## Future Enhancement: True Hunk-Level Staging
//!
//! To implement true hunk-level staging, we would need to:
//!
//! 1. Generate a unified diff between HEAD and working directory
//! 2. Parse the diff into hunks
//! 3. Filter hunks to find only version-related changes
//! 4. Apply only those hunks to the index
//! 5. Build a tree from the partially-staged file
//!
//! This is complex because:
//! - Requires diff parsing and patch application
//! - Must handle merge conflicts in hunks
//! - Needs to update index with partial file content
//!
//! The git command `git add -p` (interactive patch mode) does this, but
//! implementing it programmatically is non-trivial.

/// - Creates a commit object
/// - Updates the current branch reference
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `manifest_path` - Path to the Cargo.toml file (absolute or relative)
/// * `crate_name` - The crate/package name (for selective staging of related
///   files)
/// * `old_version` - The previous version (for verification and commit message)

///
/// let manifest = Path::new("./Cargo.toml");
/// commit_version_changes(manifest, "my-crate", "0.1.0", "0.2.0")?;
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Implementation Details
///
/// ## Repository Discovery
///
/// Uses `gix::discover()` to find the repository by walking up from the
/// manifest directory. This handles cases where the manifest is in a
/// subdirectory of the repository.
///
/// ## Change Detection
///
/// We verify version changes by:
/// 1. Reading the file from HEAD commit
/// 2. Comparing it with the working directory version
/// 3. Checking if old_version appears in HEAD and new_version in working dir
///
/// This is a heuristic - we don't parse the TOML, just check for string
/// presence. This works reliably for version fields.
///
/// ## Non-Version Change Detection
///
/// To detect non-version changes, we:
/// 1. Split both versions into lines
/// 2. Compare line-by-line
/// 3. Flag differences that don't contain "version" or version numbers
///
/// This heuristic catches most non-version changes while avoiding false
/// positives from version-related formatting changes.
///
/// ## Staging Strategy
///
/// Currently stages the entire file. The steps are:
/// 1. Write file content as a blob object
/// 2. Create an index entry pointing to the blob
/// 3. Add entry to a new index state (removing old entry if present)
/// 4. Sort entries and write index to disk
///
/// ## Tree Building
///
/// Converts the flat index into a hierarchical tree structure. See the
/// [`tree`] module for details.
///
/// ## Commit Creation
///
/// Creates a commit object with:
/// - Tree: Built from the staged index
/// - Parents: Current HEAD commit
/// - Author/Committer: From git config or defaults
/// - Message: Conventional commit format "chore(version): bump X -> Y"
///
/// ## HEAD Update
///
/// Updates the current branch reference to point to the new commit. This is
/// equivalent to `git commit` moving the branch forward.
